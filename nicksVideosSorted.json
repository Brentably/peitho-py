You are quite literally permanently changing your hormones before your body's finished developing. Not to mention you can't get this stuff legally at your age, so whoever you're getting it from, you have no idea what's in it. Taking PEDs before you're old enough can stunt your growth, anything from height to you know what. These videos are jokes but please stay safe guys.",

These are anabolic despite what people try to tell you and I got this huge 12-pack of greek yogurts. I also got an entire rotisserie chicken that I'm eating for dinner tonight because they look good and I'm fat. Oh and you can't forget the eggs. For carbs we got pasta, instant mashed potatoes, we got regular bread, we got bagels, tortillas, and last but not least beans.

Well the Inclined Curl actually targets the long head of the bicep, so it makes up a lot of that outer fullness of the bicep. And what makes it different from a standard bicep curl is essentially the range of motion. In this upwards position, your arms are down to your side and actually limits the amount of stretch that you're able to get on the long head of the bicep. Doing an Inclined Curl allows that arm to come back behind the body to get a full stretch on the long head. This is an amazing exercise to tear down those muscle fibers and build big biceps.",

You at 120 pounds are eating more calories than this guy. The reason why you think you eat a ton of calories every day is probably because you have lower hunger signaling, which means it feels like you're eating a ton of food because you're getting really full, but if you were to actually go back and properly track those calories it would not be as much as you think it is.

Ideally, you want to cut slowly to about a 200 to 400 calorie deficit underneath your maintenance. Anything above 500 calories is kind of pushing it.

If you want to see serious long term growth, you are going to have to push yourself past the point of it hurting. Number 3, doing a non-optimal exercise just because I could feel the muscle.

The first reason and probably the most important is training legs increases testosterone. Yes, you heard that right. Ironically, by training your legs you are helping your upper body gain muscle. Second reason you shouldn't skip legs is because you don't want to be that dude on the beach wearing joggers when it's like 90 degrees outside. Last reason you should be training legs is because they look sick. I mean, come on, come on, you don't have big claws, come on.",

The first thing and probably the most common I always see is people bending their wrists backwards when holding the barbell. If you're experiencing wrist pain on bench press, it is probably most likely due to this. Not only will keeping your hands upright fix that wrist pain, it'll also give you more power and strength on bench. Next mistake you might be making is loading up too much weight on the bar and bouncing it off your chest. It's okay to use a little bit of momentum on that bottom portion of the rep, but if you're literally bouncing the bar off of your rib cage, not only are you asking for an injury, you're also not helping your muscle gains at all. Last mistake I always see is people either having the bar coming down too low or too high on their chest. You want to lower the bar just to right about where your pec ends. This is the natural bar path for this movement and will help you add on strength to your bench.",

The standard pull-down attachment is going to involve more of the upper back, however the lats can be incorporated more by leaning slightly back and widening your grip. This is also a great attachment for the lats due to the pronated hand positioning, but it largely comes down to how you're actually performing the exercise. And finally, my favorite attachments. These handles provide a much more comfortable and natural grip for pulling, and are great for incorporating both the lats and upper back.",

Although it targets more of the teres muscles rather than the lats, it will still help you develop an insane V taper. Next up, I'm putting the T-bar row in A tier. Whether you do these chest supported or standing, this is an amazing exercise for developing your back. Next up, I'm gonna have to put the deadlift in C tier. A lot of people might be upset with that placement, and while deadlifts are great for strengthening your lower back, they are just not optimal for muscle hypertrophy. Next up, the barbell row is going in a solid B tier. Great overall movement when performed correctly, but hard to progressively overload while maintaining good form and safety. Next up, I'm throwing the seated machine row in a well-deserved A tier. This is one of my all-time favorite back exercises, and really allows you to isolate the lats and load up a lot of weight. This next one might be controversial, but I'm putting pull-ups in S tier. For this one, I'm specifically referring to weighted pull-ups which are absolutely incredible for developing size and width onto your lats. And they target pretty much all of the muscles in the back. Let me know what muscle group you guys want to see in the next tier list.",

The first thing, and probably the most common amongst beginners, is not hitting full depth and only going down a quarter of the way. I'm sure a lot of us have been here at some point and find it a lot easier to do more weight on the squat when you're only going down a quarter of the way. However, if you want to train squats optimally, you need to be hitting at least a 90 degree angle. Your hips should be in line with your knees. The second thing I always see is setting up your squat like this. The barbell squat is a compound movement that requires a lot of stability muscles. This includes bracing your upper body. In order to gain proper stability on a squat, you need to have your shoulders retracted and your chest up rather than being hunched over. Last mistake you might be making is bringing your knees inwards when you're going in the bottom portion of the rep. This is called knee valgus and is commonly caused from weak abductor muscles. I recommend training with a hip abductor machine and lowering the weight on squat to improve your form.",

This is the bottom portion of the rep, which basically you're slowly lowering the weight down. This can help strengthen your knees and alleviate some of that pain. The second thing I would recommend is sled pulling. Many studies have shown that sled pulling can actually have regenerative effects on your knee joint. The last thing I would recommend for knee pain is taking some time off from heavy leg pressing movements. Sometimes we push ourselves too hard in the gym and our joints simply cannot catch up. Taking some time off from these heavy compound movements is sometimes what your body needs to fully recover.",

Using dumbbells is going to require more stability within your arms, which is going to make the exercise a lot harder. However, they allow for a greater range of motion, giving you an amazing stretch in your chest fibers. So if your goal is to solely build muscle, I would go with the dumbbell variation.",

The last back exercise is the unilateral seated machine row, going heavy and controlled to really add size onto those lats.

The first thing goes along with what he was talking about in this video and that is simply moving the weight up to your arm but not actually contracting your bicep. If you are not actively feeling your biceps contracting while you're curling you are hindering your results and need to focus on my muscle connection. The second thing I always see in the gym is people leaning back when they're doing bicep curls. This is not an exercise you want to be using momentum for. In order to get the most out of this workout you need to have strict form and locked elbows. Last mistake you might be making is bringing your elbows in front of your body too much. When your elbow comes up like this you're starting to take tension off the bicep. In order to really feel that contraction you want to keep your elbows locked and down to your side.",

This is a great foundational tricep exercise, but using a bar attachment limits your range of motion and doesn't allow your arms to come fully back behind your body, which is a major function of the tricep. Next up, I'm putting the close grip bench press in the A tier category. This is an amazing tricep exercise and allows you to progressively overload without mobility issues. Speaking of mobility issues, I'm putting the overhead dumbbell tricep extension all the way down in the C tier category. While this exercise does target all three heads of the tricep, it puts a lot of strain on your elbows and rotator cuffs, meaning not a lot of people can perform these comfortably. Next up, I'm going to have to place the dip all the way up in A tier. Dips are an incredible exercise for building your triceps and have brought my arms where they are today. Next up, I'm going to have to put the dumbbell tricep kickback all the way down in D tier. Another exercise that puts a lot of strain on the rotator cuff and doesn't effectively target the heads of the tricep. I recommend doing these with cables instead. Coming in first in the S tier category is the single arm cable tricep extension. This movement allows the arm to come completely back behind the body. It also allows you to progressively overload with minimal joint pain. Last but not least, cold crushers are going to go all the way up in A tier. If you don't have problems with joint pain, this is an incredible exercise to put on some mass on your triceps. Let me know what muscle group you guys want to see next.",

Any rowing movement is going to be great for the lats and keeps tension on the muscle throughout the entire exercise. Next up I'm putting the plane pull in S tier, absolutely alpha exercise. If you're pulling a plane you probably have big lats. Next up I'm putting the single arm dumbbell row in B tier. Just because you lose some of that stability and isolation on the muscle by not having it chest supported. Coming up next, when performed correctly the barbell row is an S tier exercise for the lats. Amazing overall movement will add a ton of size to your lats. Coming in A tier is the T bar row. Whether you do these chest supported or standing it does a great job of keeping tension on the lats throughout. Next up I'm going to have to put the seated machine row in S tier. Because the machine is chest supported and you're seated perpendicular to the ground, this exercise has great potential for progressive overload. Next up I'm putting the straight arm pull down in A tier. Very solid lat movement overall and pretty interchangeable with the other A tier exercises.

This doesn't mean you do an exercise until it starts to hurt a little bit, it's a little uncomfortable, and then you stop. If you're new in the gym, sure, you'll make gains like that. But after six months to a year of training, you're gonna really need to up the intensity to continue growing. Here's an example of what low intensity looks like. I'm straight faced, not really struggling with this weight. It's kind of easy. This was a warm-up set. This is what real intensity looks like. I'm wincing, I'm struggling. I can barely get this weight up. And as you can see, I almost failed this rep right here. If you want to make some serious gains, this is how you need to train. Stop short selling yourself.",

      "text": " Shoulder exercise tier list, let's go. Coming in first behind the head overhead press is going in D tier. It's not optimal for your delts and puts a lot of strain on the rotator cuffs. Going in a well-deserved S tier is side lateral raises. If you want that 3D delt look, you need to be spamming lateral raises. It's as simple as that. Next up, I'm putting the overhead dumbbell press all the way up in the A tier category. Such an amazing exercise to put on overall size in your front and middle delts. Would highly recommend if you want those bolder shoulders. Next up, I'm gonna have to put the upright row in C tier. Puts a lot of unnecessary torque on the shoulders and there's just so many better exercises to train your front and middle delts. Going in the B tier category is face pulls. Yes, face pulls can help you target that rear delt, but they recruit a lot of help from the upper traps in the movement. Another exercise with that same problem is the reverse pec deck. Due to your hands being parallel with your shoulder, you're gonna get a lot of trap activation in this movement. Next up, I'm putting front delt raises in C tier. Your front delts get trained in almost all your pressing movements and specifically doing another exercise to target them is unnecessary in my opinion. Now the best rear delt exercise is the reverse cable fly, also known as the cable rear delt fly. This is a better version of the reverse pec deck because your arms are coming down at an angle targeting more of that rear delt. Last but not least, the barbell overhead press is going in A tier. Let me know what tier list you guys wanna see next.",

But not only does this make you at greater risk for injury, it's also not helping your muscle gains at all. Next one I see all the time at the gym is people locking out their legs. Please never ever lock out your legs on leg press. If you've seen this video, you know why. Last mistake I always see is people bringing their knees together on the leg press. This is actually called knee valgus and is usually caused by weak abductor muscles. I recommend using the hip abduction machine to strengthen these muscles, as well as lowering the weight on leg press and really focusing on your form.",
